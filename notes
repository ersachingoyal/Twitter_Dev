First we installed mongoose here, mongoose is the odm(object document mapper) here for mongodb.
Everything here is represented in the form of documents which contain data in json format. So the tables in sql
are documents here and the row are the collection here represented in the form of json

In mongo if we dont give any field as required, it wont be even shown when we fetch that collection. It will not store itself null
